## Code of Conduct

By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the Front End Colab Moderators in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/tjFkBJYEaP).
## What we're working on

Take a look at the 'issues' tab for a list of ongoing issues and proposed improvements/enhancements. We use the project board to track the progress of work.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the issues and pull requests to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

### Setting up your environment

Before you can contribute, you need to set up your development environment. Here's how you can do that:

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Install Node.js if you haven't already.
3. Navigate to the cloned directory and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. To start the development server, run `npm start`.

### Contributing Changes

Here is the workflow we follow for contributing to the project:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the [Front End Resource Hub repository](https://github.com/RW2023/fer) on GitHub. This creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine. This allows you to make and test your changes locally before pushing them.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fer.git

Remember to keep your changes as small and simple as possible. That makes them easier to manage and review.

### Pull Requests

When you're ready to submit your changes, make a pull request back to the main repo. Each pull request should:

- Be clear and concise.
- Include references to all the issues it addresses.
- Come with a brief description of the changes and the reasoning behind them.
- Be subject to peer review and potential discussion.

### Style Guide

For React components, we use functional components with hooks. Please ensure you follow the following styling practices:

- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
- Write clean, readable, and reusable code.
- Comment your code when necessary.
- Ensure your code adheres to best practices.

### Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and feature requests. Before opening an issue:

1. Ensure the issue hasn't already been reported.
2. Be clear and descriptive in your report.
