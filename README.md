# Front-End Resource Hub 🚀

Welcome to the Front-End Resource Hub project! This is a community-driven initiative from our Discord Front-End Development Community. Our goal is to create an engaging, easy-to-navigate, and comprehensive resource hub for all things related to front-end web development. 🌐

## Project Overview 📖

The Front-End Resource Hub is built using React, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience. For styling, we're leveraging Tailwind CSS, which will give us the flexibility and efficiency to create a sleek and modern UI. This project is not just about building a resource hub; it's about learning, collaborating, and growing together as a community. 🤝

## Key Features 🌟

- **Resource Catalog**: A vast collection of front-end development resources, including tutorials, tools, libraries, and best practices.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find resources with an intuitive search feature.
- **Community Contributions**: Users can submit resources, which, after review, will be added to the hub.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on any device, making learning on-the-go easier than ever.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Because we all love a bit of customization! 🌓

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
